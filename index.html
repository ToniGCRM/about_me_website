          <h3>Innovative Problem Solver</h3>
          <p class="body_text"> Do you need a smarty pants on your team? If so, look no further than Toni. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          She's got a passion for learning that is unparalelled. Just ask her colleagues, who nick-named her "Hermione" because of her strong recall ability, and willingness to jump in with an answer. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          A lifelong love of learning and growing is what pushes Toni to be the best she can be.</p>

          <h3> Quick Study</h3>
          <p class ="body_text">Toni is driven to success by her supportive and wonderful family. She has two incredibly smart, techie, nerdy daughters who inspire her on the daily. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          She's always been a quick study, and pushes herself to learn new things. Do you have a software you need someone to jump into? A database that needs an owner? Toni will jump in and learn it quickly, then passionately improve and train on that program. </p>

            <h3>Endless Grit</h3>
            <p class="body_text">One of Toni's most notable skills is her tenacity and grit. She doesn't give up on projects, teams, or fandoms easily. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She takes pride in understanding, and solving complext problems. When a tough problem comes along, she's been known to dig her heels in and grind until the problem is solved. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Cancel her favorite show? She's still a browncoat for life. </p>
